Recreated the classic game of Snake.

Based on Youtuber Bro Code's version of the game.

I added some features such as "play again" functionality, dark and light mode, and sound when the snake hits the apple

Sound effects found at FreeFx.com and mixkit.co
These sounds were not compatible with the Javax sound library so I needed to convert the sound files to 16 bit, 44100Hz, Stereo, wav format (using online-convert.com)
